    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 11/22/2024</p>
    
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our diagram-generating GPT service and the associated SVG to PNG conversion API ("the Service").</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal or sensitive information from users. The Service processes the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> Textual inputs (e.g., instructions to generate diagrams) and SVG code submitted via the API. This data is used solely for generating and converting diagrams.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> Logs (e.g., request URLs, time of access, and errors) for debugging purposes. These logs do not include personally identifiable information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information provided to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate SVG diagrams and convert them to PNG images.</li>
        <li>Improve the functionality and performance of the Service.</li>
        <li>Debug and address technical issues.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>Input data is processed in memory and discarded after the response is sent. Logs may be retained for up to one year for debugging purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your data to third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal obligations.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the data processed by the Service, including secure HTTPS communication and regular security updates.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Use by Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may rely on third-party tools (e.g., Ngrok for tunneling) to operate. These tools have their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as data access, deletion, and correction. Contact us to exercise your rights.</p>
